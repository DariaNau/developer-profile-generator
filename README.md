# developer-profile-generator

Node.js and ES6

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The application will be invoked with the following command:
node index.js
The user will be prompted for a favorite color, which will be used as the background color for cards.
# The PDF will be populated with the following:

Profile image
User name
Links to the following:

User location via Google Maps
User GitHub profile
User blog

User bio
Number of public repositories
Number of followers
Number of GitHub stars
Number of users following

Following the common templates for user stories, we can frame this challenge as follows:
AS A product manager

I WANT a developer profile generator

SO THAT I can easily prepare reports for stakeholders
Refer to the design mockup.

#  Business Context
When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

#  Minimum Requirements

Functional, deployed application.

GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

The application generates a PDF resume from the user provided GitHub profile.

The generated resume includes a bio image from the user's GitHub profile.

The generated resume includes the user's location and a link to their GitHub profile.

The generated resume includes the number of: public repositories, followers, GitHub stars and following count.

The background color of the generated PDF matches the color that the user provides.

GIVEN the developer has a GitHub profile

WHEN prompted for the developer's GitHub username and favorite color

THEN a PDF profile is generated

Commit Early and Often
One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

# Follow these guidelines for committing:

Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have more than 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

# Hints / Tips / Direction

Running your application from the command line will require some user input (github username and favorite color). Your app should at least accepts some arguments after "node index.js" to capture this user input, but the inquirer package is a more robust choice!

https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer 

As web developers, the most approachable way to create a .pdf file would be to first generate some html! (a string of or an entire file) Then, we can simply convert that html into a .pdf file with a conversion package from NPM. There are several packages that would work very well for this, including:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-html-to 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/html5-to-pdf 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-creator-node (note: this library uses a template system that is a little different from the other two options listed)

Take a look at the above options and feel free to even search for your own conversion tool! This is a great opportunity to practice surfing through https://npmjs.com to find a library that suits your needs.

In order to create the content necessary for the pdf, we'll need information from github. All the information we need is available through the github api: https://developer.github.com/v3

To get ALL the information outlined in the Minimum Requirements section, we'll need two different endpoints:

https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user - Users Endpoint

Example GET url: https://api.github.com/users/jsatlien

https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/ - Repos Endpoint

Example GET url: https://api.github.com/users/jsatlien/repos

We will need to use the ajax-like functionality of axios (https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to call these endpoints
